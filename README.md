# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project - Flash Cards Game

### Project Overview
This project used ruby and rspec to demonstrate test driven development, where criteria were specified and code was later written to achieve the objectives outlined in tests. 3 iterations were completed using 4 spec files and 4 classes. 

#### List out the tools you used:
1. VS Code
2. Mac Terminal
3. RSpec
4. Ruby
5. Ruby classes
6. pry
7. Test Driven Development (TDD)
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

This project loads a deck of cards and quizzes the user on trivia knowledge. It is capable of organizing cards by category. It evaluates the user responses as correct or false and reports a score of the round. 

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />
When I don't have all the information I need for a problem, I first organize what I do know. Then I look at my next step and see what I might need to find to complete the next step. I usually start with a search of Turing resources and my notes. If I don't find what I need there, I continue to google or my cohort. 

**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />
My most effective strategy when faced with a blocker was relying on my cohort. I'm thankful it's full of smart people I can rely on. Once I got the help I needed to continue, I would refactor the code to make sure I understood. 

**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
One night, Billy and I had spent 30-45 minutes with the same error. It was getting late so I reached out to my cohort for help and it turned out we were just missing some punctuation. 

**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />
TDD helps establish the goals of the project and then to build the important classes, methods and variables to satisfy them. It can be a kind of cypher when opening the project the next morning to see what outputs what. 


## First Solo - Beat Box

### Project Overview
The Beat Box project used Ruby classes to create a linked list of beat box sounds in order to make my computer beat box. 

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Test Driven Development
2. RSpec testing
3. Ruby Classes
4. VS Code
5. Mac Terminal
6. Github

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
The Beat Box project used Ruby classes to create a linked list of beat box sounds in order to make my computer beat box. 
Methods for the linked list included append, prepend, count, insert, and pop. 

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**<br />

Test Driven Development was pivotal on this project. It changed my perspective from writing code, to writing code to meet goals I set. Although I don't have it perfected, I saw how TDD can help programmers see edge cases before diving into the code. Then when they do dive in, they are better prepared to address edge cases.

**2. What was your process when you got stuck?**<br /> Similar to other projects, I would first check out the stack trace to see if I made a simple error. Next I would turn to the internet for an explanation. If I couldn't find an answer there, I would check with my cohort. 


**3. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?**<br />
To do this project differently, I might allow myself more time and space to complete the extensions. I would have started a list of approved beats at the beginning of the project so I didn't have to go back and find them later. 

## Second Solo - the DMV

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Nested Collections
2. Hashes
3. API
4. Test Driven Development
5. RSpec testing
6. Ruby Classes
7. VS Code
8. Mac Terminal
9. Github

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

### Reflection Questions: 
**1 Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
I started by running the rspec file and seeing what falures resulted. I systematically worked thorugh the failures one by one to address the issues. Once I thought one was addressed, I would re-run rspec to see if it was solved. If it was, I would move on to the next failed test. After solving the failures, I read through the .lib files and tried to make sense of how the classes interacted. 
**2 What was hard about working with code you did not write?
It was hard to put someone else's code under a microscope and find the smaller errors in it, like missing syntax. It also took some time to look through the classes and understand how they interacted.  
**3 What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
With some experience in fixing failues and reading rspec output and stack trace, it was somewhat easy to pinpoint where errors happened.
