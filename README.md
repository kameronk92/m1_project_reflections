# M1 Project Reflections

## Warmup Project - Flash Cards Game

### Project Overview
This project used ruby and rspec to demonstrate test driven development, where criteria were specified and code was later written to achieve the objectives outlined in tests. 3 iterations were completed using 4 spec files and 4 classes. 

#### List out the tools you used:
1. VS Code
2. Mac Terminal
3. RSpec
4. Ruby
5. Ruby classes
6. Test Driven Development (TDD)
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

This project loads a deck of cards and quizzes the user on trivia knowledge. It is capable of organizing cards by category. It evaluates the user responses as correct or false and reports a score of the round. 

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />
When I don't have all the information I need for a problem, I first organize what I do know. Then I look at my next step and see what I might need to find to complete the next step. I usually start with a search of Turing resources and my notes. If I don't find what I need there, I continue to google or my cohort. 

**2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />
My most effective strategy when faced with a blocker was relying on my cohort. I'm thankful it's full of smart people I can rely on. Once I got the help I needed to continue, I would refactor the code to make sure I understood. 

**3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
One night, Billy and I had spent 30-45 minutes with the same error. It was getting late so I reached out to my cohort for help and it turned out we were just missing some punctuation. 

**4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />
TDD helps establish the goals of the project and then to build the important classes, methods and variables to satisfy them. It can be a kind of cypher when opening the project the next morning to see what outputs what.
